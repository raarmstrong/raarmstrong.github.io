The second, tensions in decision‐making about mode of anaesthesia, comprised four subthemes: clinical autonomy and guidelines in anaesthesia; conforming to norms in mode of anaesthesia; the relationship between expertise, preference and patient involvement; and team dynamics in emergency surgery.

    <p class="pub-abstract"><p>Although delivering a chosen mode of anaesthesia for certain emergency surgery procedures is potentially beneficial to patients, it is a complex intervention to evaluate.

A qualitative researcher conducted interviews with clinicians and patients. Thematic analysis was applied to the interview transcripts.</p>
