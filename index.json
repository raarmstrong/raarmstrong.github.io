This qualitative study explored clinician and patient perspectives about mode of anaesthesia for emergency surgery.\n\nSnowball sampling was used to recruit participants from eight National Health Service Trusts that cover the following three emergency surgery settings: ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms, hip fractures and inguinal hernias. A qualitative researcher conducted interviews with clinicians and patients. Thematic analysis was applied to the interview transcripts.\n\nInterviews were conducted with 21 anaesthetists, 21 surgeons, 14 operating theatre staff and 23 patients. There were two main themes. The first, impact of mode of anaesthesia in emergency surgery, had four subthemes assessing clinician and patient ideas about: context and the ‘best’ mode of anaesthesia; balance in choosing it over others; change and developments in anaesthesia; and the importance of mode of anaesthesia in emergency surgery. The second, tensions in decision‐making about mode of anaesthesia, comprised four subthemes: clinical autonomy and guidelines in anaesthesia; conforming to norms in mode of anaesthesia; the relationship between expertise, preference and patient involvement; and team dynamics in emergency surgery. The results highlight several interlinking factors affecting decision‐making, including expertise, preference, habit, practicalities, norms and policies.\n\nThere is variation in practice in choosing the mode of anaesthesia for surgery, alongside debate as to whether anaesthetic autonomy is necessary or results in a lack of willingness to change.","tags":["Mode of anaesthesia"],"title":"Qualitative study of clinician and patient perspectives on the mode of anaesthesia for emergency surgery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["RA Armstrong","C Kane","F Oglesby","K Barnard","J Soar","M Thomas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557446400,"objectID":"5c18374e906963f37f2e9b7f5d3625bc","permalink":"https://raarmstrong.github.io/publication/incidence-of-cardiac-arrest-in-icu/","publishdate":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/incidence-of-cardiac-arrest-in-icu/","section":"publication","summary":"The incidence of cardiac arrest in the intensive care unit (ICU-CA) has not been widely reported. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting the incidence of cardiac arrest in adult, general intensive care units. The review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017079717). The search identified 7550 records, which included 20 relevant studies for qualitative analysis and 16 of these were included for quantitative analyses. The reported incidence of ICU-CA was 22.7 per 1000 admissions (95% CI: 17.4–29.6) with survival to hospital discharge of 17% (95% CI: 9.5–28.5%). We estimate that at least 5446 patients in the UK have a cardiac arrest after ICU admission. There are limited data and significant variation in the incidence of ICU-CA and efforts to synthesise these are limited by inconsistent reporting. Further prospective studies with standardised process and incidence measures are required to define this important patient group.","tags":["R"],"title":"The incidence of cardiac arrest in the intensive care unit: A systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"publication"}]
