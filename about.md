I am an anaesthetist in the Severn Deanery and a GW4-CAT PhD Programme for Health Professionals PhD Fellow studying the use of multiomics in predicting and understanding immune-mediated complications of anaesthesia and surgery. I am also a Research Fellow at the Royal College of Anaesthetists Centre for Research and Improvement.

I am interested in the application of machine learning and causal inference techniques to both routinely collected and 'omics data to improve patient outcomes after surgery.
