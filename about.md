I am an anaesthetist in the Severn Deanery and a GW4-CAT PhD Programme for Health Professionals PhD Fellow studying the use of multiomics in predicting and understanding immune-mediated complications of anaesthesia and surgery. I am also a Research Fellow at the Royal College of Anaesthetists Centre for Research and Improvement.

My research interests are in using routinely collected healthcare data and multiple 'omics to improve patient outcomes after surgery.
